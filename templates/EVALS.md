If AI were used to generate full captions, I would evaluate them by:

1. **Checking factual components**  
   - Does the caption include the player?  
   - Is the minute correct?  
   - Is the event type correctly reflected?

2. **Checking clarity and brevity**  
   Captions should be short and match the tone of sports highlight cards.

3. **Consistency with schema**  
   Ensure `headline` and `caption` follow the pattern used by other pages.
